Prediciting Personality Traits: Classifying Extroverts vs Introverts from Behavorial Data

# project goal
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning classifier that can classify whether someone is an introvert, or an extrovert based on their behavior. In this study, rather than using self-report questionnaires as is typically the case, in vivo behavior measures (such as time spent alone, party going, stage fright, social media use, and fatigue after socializing) will be used to inform an evidence-based approach to demonstrating personality. 

# dataset overview
The dataset chosen for this assignment was obtained from Kaggle, titled ‘Extrovert vs. Introvert Behavior Data’. It is a collection of social and behavioral data that includes extroversion and introversion indicators. The dataset is stored in a comma separated values (CSV) format, making it compatible with Python and many other programming languages and tools. It contains 2,900 entries with 8 columns related to social and behavioral tendencies and personality classification. It includes both numerical and categorical features.
